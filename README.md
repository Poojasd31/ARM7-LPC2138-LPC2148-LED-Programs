# ARM7-LPC2138-LPC2148-LED-Programs

ARM7 microcontrollers like LPC2138 and LPC2148 from NXP are widely used in embedded systems. They are based on the ARM7TDMI-S CPU core and support GPIO, timers, UART, ADC, I2C, SPI, and more. Controlling LEDs is usually the first step in learning GPIO programming.
